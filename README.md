## Meet Sepp: Our Cyberpunk Mascot

Say hello to Sepp, our cyberpunk mascot and proud [Ibex](https://alpshiking.swisshikingvacations.com/spotlight-on-the-ibex/). Sepp, hailing from the Swiss Alps, loves wandering through the Eiger mountains. Despite occasional Viking-like bluntness, he's a helpful companion who traces his lineage back to Viking times.

The name "Sepp" is indeed a German diminutive or nickname for the name Joseph. It's similar to how "Joe" is used as a nickname for Joseph in English. In German-speaking regions, it's common for Joseph to be affectionately referred to as "Sepp."

This is our little tribute to one of the creators of the Erlang programming language, [Joe Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer)).
