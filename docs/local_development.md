# Local Development

> **_NOTE:_** All scripts will use a MySQL DB with a database called eigr-functions-db by default. Make sure you have a working instance on your localhost or you will have to change make tasks or run commands manually during testing.

Tests:

```shell
make test
```

Run:

```shell
make build run-proxy-local
```
